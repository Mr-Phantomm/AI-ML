"""

Numbers are of three types:-
    1. Integer (int)
    2. Float (float)
    3. Complex (complex)

To check any Variable type we use function of type()

--> Integer :- Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
--> Float :- Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
--> complex :- Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:

Converting type :-

to float--> float(x)
to int--> int(y)
to complex--> complex(x)


"""
#convert from int to float:
x = float(1)

#convert from float to int:
y = int(2.8)

#convert from int to complex:
z = complex(1)

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
